Part 2:  

Graceful degradation and service workers are related in the context of enhancing web applications' reliability and user experience. Graceful degradation is where an application is built to provide a basic level of functionality in all environments, even if some advanced features are not supported. Service workers play a significant role in graceful degradation by providing offline capabilities, caching resources, and handling network requests. When network conditions are poor or unavailable, service workers ensure that core functionalities remain accessible, maintaining a usable experience for the user. This interaction between the two allows web applications to degrade and still offer essential services, enhancing overall robustness of code and user satisfaction.
